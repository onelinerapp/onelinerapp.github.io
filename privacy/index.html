			<p>Our keyboard doesn&rsquo;t have Internet access, so can&rsquo;t transmit any information. Furthermore, due to our unique design, there is no keystroke information for us to collect in the first place.</p>
			<p>Apple may provide us with user metrics through the App Store. We do not share this information with anyone else.</p>
			<p>In the future, we may update this privacy policy under a variety of circumstances. For example, if our app functionality changes, we may update the policy to reflect those changes. The current and correct privacy policy will be posted at this URL.</p>
			<p>This privacy policy was last updated on 2017-06-06.</p>
